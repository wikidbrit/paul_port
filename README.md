This project has some goals not outlined in previous attempts to create something I am happy to display and host publicly. 
1. Create a unique brand that is optimized for web 
2. Branding able to interact in a unique way with the user
3. Minimal UI light on the content
4. Focus on expression rather than expected user experiences in web
5. Be proud of it, and continually improve it
